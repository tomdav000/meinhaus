I created this programme shortly upon healing from a broken humerus, with nerve damage. I needed to rebuild my strength, muscular endurance, and size that resulted from the atrophy that occured, and this programme was the programme that not only gotten me to my previous strength levels, but allowed me to surpass them. Donâ€™t be afraid to push yourself a little further when it comes to reps, at the time of my writing of this program, these were the amount of reps I was capable of. You are capable of much more than you know, and think.",
